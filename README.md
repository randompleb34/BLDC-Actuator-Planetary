# BLDC-Actuator-Planetary

Status: In Progress - Preceded by BLDC-Actuator-Cyclodial-Drive-

BDLC Actuator powered by T-Motor RI70 KV95 and Moteus 4.9/4.11 Controller

Designed in Fusion 360

Description:

A well needed successor to the original cyclodial drive gearbox, this new actuator imploys a tiny 5:1 planetary gearbox that sits within the strator of a RI70 inrunner brushless motor, completely different from outrunner BDLC actuators used on the MIT Cheetah and MJBot Quadruped.
The gearbox is designed to be fully 3D printable (FDM, futher testing with SLA and SLS to come), allowing the actuator to be as affordable as possible (~260 USD).

Dimensions: 51mm x 85mm x 85mm (45% height reduction compared to Cyclodial Drive)
